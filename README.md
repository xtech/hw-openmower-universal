# OpenMower Mainboard for YardForce Mowers



## Information

This hardware version is in beta state. Expect for things to not work at the current state!

If you want to build an OpenMower based on a YardForce platform, I recommend the tested v1 hardware.



## About This Repo

OpenMower is an open-source project that upgrades off-the-shelf robotic mowers into modern, smart lawn mowing robots with RTK GPS technology. For more details, check out the [OpenMower project](https://github.com/clemensElflein/openmower).

This repository contains the design files for a custom mainboard specifically designed for converting YardForce mowers to OpenMower. 



## List of Compatible Mowers

This mainboard is compatible with the following mower models:

- YardForce Classic 500(B)
- YardForce SA-series mowers (SA650, SA900, ...)



## Additional Information

This mainboard is the reference board for OpenMower and includes more features than actually required to build an OpenMower robot. This way it can be used as a template for other mower models. Additional features include a gigabit Ethernet switch, LiPo charger, and a 12V auxiliary power supply for extensions.
